Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


This project contains information about me and some of my interests.  There are a few different files within the project build.  
The project also uses some architecture from the bootstrap framework.

First there is an image folder which contains all the images that are used within the website.

There are four HTML files included in the project, each has a navigation element to move through each page of the website
   1. index.html - this is the homepage of the project that has a paragraph about me.
   2. destiny2.html - this file dives into one of my favorite video games. showcasing a list and grid layout
   3. table.html - I am a big basketball fan, this showcases a table with the top five scorers 
       of all time in the NBA as well as a grid layout with pictures of each of them
   4. photos.html - I inlcuded a photos pages that has some photos of my adventures and my dog!


There are also files to help with styling.  I used sass and a scss file to do the bulk of my styling.  
This automatically created the style in the css file for me which is linked on each page.


Thanks for stopping by!
