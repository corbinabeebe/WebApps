      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there and welcome to my web page! My name is Corbin and I am a currently studying Computer Science at Colorado State University - Global. Throughout my studies and exploration of different programming languages, I have found a deep interest in Java and android development. Part of this desire, I'll admit is a little bit selfish, I have always been an android user and I have always been interested in how and why things are done. This has driven my interest to be able to make apps   that I can use on my own phones. My curiosity into why and how things are built or developed has been something that has only grown thoughout my life and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>Witnessing the advancement of technology over the past decade has led me to find something that I am passionate about, challenges me and is vey rewarding when you finally get your project to actually do what you intend.
        This ties directly into understanding how my cell phone, my pc and favorites video games, Destiny 2 and Clash of Clans, function behind the scenes. I am not only understanding how programs like this are made, but I can build them myself.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout this website, you can find various information about me such as my likes, hobbies and passions. Enjoy your time here and have a good time!!</p>
